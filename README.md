# Melody-Generator
Will create a melody that will fit over a chord progression when finished.

Right now, the code will take a single chord input based on the notes in the chord and find keys that exactly match that chord.
A random melody will then be generated with that key by using a weighted system that favors the root note of the chord. In the future I 
plan on having it accept multiple chords and find ways to change keys/scales mid line. I would also like to add a timing element so that
it assigns everything from 16th notes to whole notes at specific timings.

I'm still very new to coding and python so this is mostly a way to learn.
